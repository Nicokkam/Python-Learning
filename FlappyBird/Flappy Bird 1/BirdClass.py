    pass through the space in between pipes (for every pipe passed, one
    point is scored); if it crashes into a pipe, the game ends.

    Attributes:
    x: The bird's X coordinate.

    msec_to_climb: The number of milliseconds left to climb, where a
        complete climb lasts Bird.CLIMB_DURATION milliseconds.

    Constants:
    WIDTH: The width, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    HEIGHT: The height, in pixels, of the bird's image.
    SINK_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        descends in one second while not climbing.
    CLIMB_SPEED: With which speed, in pixels per millisecond, the bird
        ascends in one second while climbing, on average.  See also the
        Bird.update docstring.
